1. Go to `travis-ci.org` (or .com if you're setting it up for private projects) and sign in with GitHub - there's a login button at the top right corner.

There you will be prompted to authorize access to your account.

If this is the first time accessing travis ci, you will be presented with a getting started page, that you need to go to your profile in order to activate the repository you want integrated.

You can get to your profile by clicking the `+` sign at the left hand panel next to the header `My Repositories`.

On your profile, you will see your repositories, and can enable/disable repositories. So, flick on the repository you are hoping to integrate.
